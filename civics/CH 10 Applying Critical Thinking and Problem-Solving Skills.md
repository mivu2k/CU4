**Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving Skills:**
Critical thinking and problem-solving are crucial for analyzing situations, identifying issues, and finding effective solutions. These skills involve systematically evaluating information, making reasoned judgments, and implementing solutions that address the root cause of a problem. 

**Steps in critical thinking and problem solving:**
1. **Identify the Problem:** Clearly define the issue you're trying to address. Be as specific as possible to focus your efforts.  
2. **Gather Relevant Information:** Collect data, opinions, and arguments related to the problem from various sources.  
3. **Analyze and Evaluate the Information**: Sift through the gathered information to determine what is relevant, reliable, and unbiased.  
4. **Consider Multiple Perspectives**: Explore different viewpoints and potential solutions, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each. 
5. **Draw Logical Conclusions**: Based on your analysis, develop reasoned conclusions and propose solutions that address the problem.  
6. **Communicate Solutions Effectively**: Share your findings, rationale, and proposed solutions with others, ensuring clear and concise communication.  
7. **Evaluate and Refine**: After implementing the solution, assess its effectiveness and make adjustments as needed to optimize the outcome. 

**Example (Normal Life):**
Imagine there are frequent power outages in Jinnah Garden, Islamabad.
1. Identify the Problem: The problem is recurring power outages in the Jinnah Garden area.  
2. Gather Information: Investigate the frequency, duration, and potential causes of the outages by checking news reports, local media, and speaking with residents.
3. Analyze and Evaluate: Analyze the data to determine if there's a pattern, identify potential infrastructure issues, or consider if external factors like weather are involved.  
4. Consider Perspectives: Discuss with residents and local authorities to understand their perspectives and potential solutions.  
5. Draw Conclusions: Based on the analysis, a possible solution might be to improve the local power grid, address aging infrastructure, or implement more robust weather monitoring systems.
6. Communicate Solutions: Share the proposed solutions with residents and relevant authorities, outlining the rationale and potential benefits. 
7. Evaluate and Refine: Monitor the frequency of outages after implementing the solution and make adjustments if necessary to optimize the outcome. 

**Why is critical thinking important?**
- Critical thinking is useful in many areas of your life, including your career. It makes you a well-rounded individual, one who has looked at all of their options and possible solutions before making a choice.
- According to the University of the People in California, having critical thinking skills is important because they are [1
	- **Universal**
	- **Crucial for the economy**
	- **Essential for improving language and presentation skills**
	- **Very helpful in promoting creativity**
	- **Important for self-reflection**
	- **The basis of science and democracy** 
- Critical thinking skills are used every day in a myriad of ways and can be applied to situations such as a CEO approaching a group project or a nurse deciding in which order to treat their patients.

**How to develop critical thinking skills**
You can develop critical thinking skills every day if you approach problems in a logical manner. Explore a few ways you can start your path to improvement:
**1. Ask questions.**
	Be inquisitive about everything. Maintain a neutral perspective and develop a natural curiosity, so you can ask questions that develop your understanding of the situation or task at hand. The more details, facts, and information you have, the better informed you are to make decisions.

**2. Practice active listening.**
	Utilize active listening techniques, which are founded in empathy, to really listen to what the other person is saying. Critical thinking, in part, is the cognitive process of reading the situation: the words coming out of their mouth, their body language, their reactions to your own words. Then, you might paraphrase to clarify what they're saying, so both of you agree you're on the same page.

**3. Develop your logic skill in critical thinking.**
	 This is perhaps a more abstract task that requires practice and long-term development. However, think of a schoolteacher assessing the classroom to determine how to energize the lesson. You have options such as playing a game, watching a video, or challenging the students with a reward system. Using logic, you might decide that the reward system will take up too much time and is not an immediate fix. A video may not be relevant at this time. So, you may decide to play a simple word association game.

**Scenarios like this happen every day, so next time, you can be more aware of what will work and what won't. Over time, developing your logic and reasoning will strengthen your critical thinking skills.**

**Examples of common critical thinking skills**
Critical thinking skills differ from individual to individual and are utilized in various ways. Examples of common critical thinking skills include:
- **Identification of biases:** 
	**I**dentifying biases means knowing there are certain people or things that may have an unfair prejudgment or influence on the situation at hand. Pointing out these biases helps to remove them from contention when it comes to solving the problem and allows you to see things from a different perspective.
- **Research:** 
	Researching details and facts allows you to be prepared when presenting your information to people. You’ll know exactly what you’re talking about due to the time you’ve spent with the subject material, and you’ll be well-spoken and know what questions to ask to gain more knowledge. When researching, always use credible sources and factual information.
- **Problem-solving:**
	Problem-solving is perhaps the most important skill that critical thinkers can possess. The ability to solve issues and bounce back from conflict is what helps you succeed, be a leader, and effect change. One way to properly solve problems is to first recognize there’s a problem that needs solving. By determining the issue at hand, you can then analyze it and come up with several potential solutions.
