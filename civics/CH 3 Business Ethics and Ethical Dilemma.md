**Ethical Dilemmas**
- An ethical dilemma is a problem in the decision-making process between two possible options, neither of which is absolutely acceptable from an ethical perspective. 
- Sometimes called ethical paradoxes in moral philosophy.

**Example**
- Is it ethical for you to inform a subordinate about next year’s business plan? It depends. 
-  If you have permission to share the information and doing so improves the subordinate’s performance, then it is very ethical.
- However, if sharing the information violates a conﬁdentiality agreement and the subordinate is likely to misuse the information, then it is very unethical.

**Types of Ethical Dilemmas**
The following twelve categories are discussed in book “Business Ethics Case Studies and Selected Readings” by Marianne Moody Jennings. 

-  **_Taking Things That Don’t Belong To You_**
	-  Unauthorised use of someone else’s property or taking property under false pretenses still means taking something that does not belong to you.
	- E.g. using the copy machine at work for personal copies. 

- **_Saying Things, You Know are Not True_** 
	-  This category deals with the virtue of honesty. 
	- E.g. Assume you are trying to sell your car, one in which you had an accident, but which you have repaired. If the potential buyer asks if the car has been in an accident and you reply, “No,” then you have given false information. 

-  **_Giving or Allowing False Impressions_** 
	- This category of ethical breach is the legal technicality category. What you have said is technically the truth, but it does mislead the other side. 
	- For example, if your supervisor asks you, “Did you have a chance to read the assigned ethics cases?” Even if you had not read the cases, you could answer a “Yes!” and be technically correct. You had “a chance” to read the cases; but you did not read them. The answer is not a falsehood, because you may have had plenty of chances to read the cases, but you didn’t read the cases.

- **_Buying Inﬂuence or Engaging in Conﬂict of Interest_** 
	- This category ﬁnds someone in the position of conﬂicting loyalties. 
	- E.g. an oﬃcer of a corporation should not be entering into contracts between his company and a company that he has created as part of a sideline of work. The oﬃcer is conﬂicted between his duty to negotiate the best contract and price for his corporation and his interest as a business owner in maximizing his proﬁts. In his role as an oﬃcer, he wants the most he can get at the lowest price. In his role as a business owner, he wants the highest price he can get with the fewest demands. 

- **_Hiding or Revealing Information_** 
	- Taking your ﬁrm’s product development or trade secrets to a new place of employment constitutes an ethical violation: divulging proprietary information. 
	- E.g. failing to disclose the results of medical studies that indicate your ﬁrm’s new drug has signiﬁcant side eﬀects is the ethical violation of hiding information that the product could be harmful to purchasers. 
	- A bank that sells ﬁnancial and marketing information about its customers without their knowledge or permission has divulged information that should be kept conﬁdential.

- **_Taking Unfair Advantage_** 

	- Many current consumer protection laws were passed because so many businesses took unfair advantage of those who were not educated or were unable to recognize the degrees of complex contracts. 
	- E.g. one of the newer issues with credit cards is that the late fees have increased, as well as the fees for charging more than the card balance. In addition, companies have been shortening the billing cycle so that customers have less time to pay and have been establishing the cutoﬀ times for payment earlier in the day. If payment must be received by 9 AM on a particular day, this cutoﬀ means that the customer must pay one day earlier because mail does not arrive by 9 AM. 

- **_Committing Acts of Personal Decadence_** 
	- Sometimes our conduct in our personal lives does have an impact on how well we perform our jobs, and perhaps even whether we can perform our jobs safely. 
	- For example, a company driver must abstain from substance abuse because with alcohol or drugs in his blood, he creates both safety and liability issues for his employer. 

- **_Committing Interpersonal Abuse_** 

	- Interpersonal abuse consists of conduct that is depreciating, unfair, or unfriendly, or involves others so that privacy issues arise. A manager who is verbally abusive to an employee falls into this category. 
	- E.g. The former CEO of HealthSouth, Richard Scrushy, held what his employees called the “Monday morning beatings.” These were meetings during which managers who had not met their numbers goals were scolded in front of others and subjected to humiliating criticism. 

- **_Permitting Organisational Abuse_** 
	- This category covers the way companies treat employees. Many U.S. ﬁrms with operations overseas, such as Nike, The Gap, and Esprit, have faced questions related to organisational abuse. The questions focus on the treatment of workers in these companies’ international operations and plants. 
	- E.g. the critical issues raised are child labor, low wages, and overly long work hours. 

-  **_Violating Rules_** 
	- Many rules, particularly those in large organizations that tend toward bureaucracy from a need to maintain internal controls or follow lines of authority, seem burdensome to employees trying to serve customers and other employees. 
	- E.g. Stanford University experienced diﬃculties in this area of ethics when it used funds from federal grants for miscellaneous university purposes. Questions arose about the propriety of the expenditures, which quite possibly could have been legal under federal regulations in place at the time, but were not within the standards, policies, and guidelines on what were considered appropriate research expenditures. 

- **_Excusing Unethical Actions_** 
	- In this category, the wrong is actually a failure to report an ethical breach in any of the other categories. 
	- A sparkling tolerance of others’ unethical behavior is in itself unethical. 
	- E.g. What if you witnessed a fellow employee misusing company funds by faking her signature on a check that was to be cancelled? Would you report that violation?.

- **_Balancing Ethical Dilemmas_** 
	- In these types of situations, there are no right or wrong answers; rather, there are dilemmas to be resolved.
	- E.g. Levi Strauss and Google both struggled with their decisions on whether to do business in the China because of government’s censorship on information distribution. Google reasoned that some information available through the Internet was better than the Chinese people having no access at all. 

**Why study types of Ethical Dilemmas**

- These twelve categories are resources for you to use as you analyze the case studies. 
- As you read, think through the twelve categories and determine what ethical breaches have occurred. 
- These categories help you in spotting the ethical issues in each of the cases.

**How we Avoid Ethical Dilemmas**

- We often are able to see ethical issues, in many cases, we use certain strategies to avoid facing ethical issues. 

- **_Call It by a Different Name_** 
	- If we can attach a lovely label to what we are doing, we won’t have to face the ethical issue. 
	- **_For example,_** some people, including U.S. Justice Department lawyers, refer to the downloading of music from the Internet as copyright infringement. However, many who download music assure us that it is really just the lovely practice of peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing. How can something that sounds so generous be an ethical issue? Yet there is an ethical issue because copying copyrighted music without permission is taking something that does not belong to you or taking unfair advantage. 

- **_Rationalising Dilemmas Away: “Everybody Else Does It”_** 
	- We can feel very comfortable and not have to face an ethical issue if we simply assure ourselves, “Everybody else does it.” We use faulty ethical reasoning to conclude that it must be right because so many people are doing it. 
	- E.g. “Everybody speeds, and so I speed.” There remains the problem that speeding is still a breach of one of the ethical categories: following the rules. Although you may feel the speed limit is too low or unnecessary, your ethical obligation is to follow those speed limits unless and until you successfully persuade others to change the laws because of your valid points about speed limits. 

- **_Rationalising Dilemmas Away: “If We Don’t Do It, Someone Else Will”_** 
	- This rationalisation is one used frequently by businesspeople as they face tough competition. They grasp this rationalisation because they can ignore the ethical issue in the name of business survival. They are saying, “Someone will do it anyway and make money, so why shouldn’t it be us?” 
	- E.g. Halloween 1994, there were O. J. Simpson masks and plastic knives and Nicole Brown Simpson masks and costumes complete with slashes and blood stains. When Nicole Simpson’s family objected to this violation of the basic standard of decency, a costume shop owner commented that if he didn’t sell the items, someone down the street would. 

- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “That’s the Way It Has Always Been Done”_** 
	- When we hear, “That’s the way it’s always been done,” our innovation feelers as well as our ethical radar should be up. We should be asking, “Is there a better way to do this?” Just as “Everybody does it” is not ethical analysis, neither is relying on the past and its standards a process of ethical reasoning. Business practices are not always sound. 
	- E.g.  the ﬁeld of corporate governance within business ethics has taught for years that a good board for a company has independent directors, that is, directors who are not employed by the company, under consulting contracts with the company, or related to oﬃcers of the company. Independent boards were good ethical practice, but many companies resisted because their boards had always been structured a certain way and they would stick to that, saying, “This is the way our board has always looked.”


- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “We’ll Wait until the Lawyers Tell Us It’s Wrong”_** 

	- Many people rely only on the law as their ethical standard, but that reliance means that they have resolved only the legal issue, not the ethical one. 
	- For example, a team of White House lawyers concluded in a memo in March 2003 that international law did not ban torture of prisoners in Iraq because they were technically not prisoners of war. However, when pictures of prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq emerged, the reaction of the public and the world was very diﬀerent..

- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “It Doesn’t Really Hurt Anyone”_** 
	- We often think that our ethical missteps are just small ones that don’t really aﬀact anyone else. We are not thinking through the consequences of our actions when we rationalize rather than analyze ethical issues in this manner. 
	- For example, it is probably true that one fraudulent insurance claim is not going to bankrupt an insurance company. However, if everyone who believes his or her fraud is singular and isolated submitted a false insurance claim, we could create what happened in California when fraud overtook its workers’ compensation system. 

- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “The System Is Unfair”_** 
	- Somehow an ethical breach doesn’t seem as bad if we feel we are doing it because we have been given an unfair hand. 
	- E.g. As we see events unfold in China, Italy, and Brazil, with government employees awarding contracts and rights to do business on the basis of payments rather than on the merits of a given company or its proposal, we understand how such bribery only results in greater unfairness within and greater costs to those countries. 

- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “It’s a Gray Area”_** 
	- One of the most popular rationalizations of recent years has been to claim, “Well, business doesn’t have black and white. There’s a great deal of gray.” Sometimes the extent of ethical analysis in a business situation is to merely state, “It’s a gray area,” and the response from the group holding the discussion is “Fine! So long as we’re in the gray area, we’re moving on.” Again, many of the practices with stock options were in a “gray area.” 
	- E.g. at Enron, the accounting practice of spinning debt oﬀ the books was a gray area. 


- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “I Was Just Following Orders”_** 
	- In many criminal trials and disputes over responsibility and liability, many managers will disclaim their responsibility by stating, “I was just following orders.”
	- E.g. Again, the example of the prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq illustrates that even if the soldiers were following orders, they could not call their abusive conduct ethical.


- **_Rationalizing Dilemmas Away: “We All Don’t Share the Same Ethics”_** 
	- This rationalization is used quite frequently in companies with international operations. We often hear, “Well, this is culturally acceptable in other countries.” 
	- Name one culture where individuals are known to claim, “There is nothing I like better than having a good old-fashioned fraud committed against me,”. This rationalization is a failure to acknowledge that there are some common values that demand universal application and consideration as we grapple with our decisions and behaviors around the world.
