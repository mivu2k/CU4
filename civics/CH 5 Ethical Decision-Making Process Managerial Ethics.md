**Ethical Decision Making**
- In the context of decision making, your ethics are your personal standards of right and wrong.
- Your ethics are your basis for making ethically sensitive decisions.
- Ethical decision-making refers to the process of evaluating and choosing among alternatives in a manner consistent with ethical principles.
- In making ethical decisions, it is necessary to perceive and eliminate unethical options and select the best ethical alternative.

**Approaches to Ethical Decision-Making**
Cavanagh’s approaches to ethical decision-making:
1.        Utilitarian Approach: Does it optimize the satisfactions of the stakeholders?
2.        Rights Approach: Does it respect the rights of the individuals involved
3.        Justice: Is it consistent with the canons of justice?

**Ethical Decision Making**
The process of making ethical decisions requires:
- Commitment: The desire to do the right thing regardless of the cost
- Consciousness: The awareness to act consistently and apply moral beliefs to daily behavior
- Competency: The ability to collect and evaluate information, develop alternatives, and foresee potential consequences and risks

**Character-Based Decision-Making Model**
- The Character-Based Decision-Making Model was created by the Josephson Institute of Ethics, and it has three main components leaders can use to make an ethical decision.
- All decisions must take into account and reflect a concern for the interests and well being of all affected individuals ("stakeholders").
- Ethical values and principles always take priority over non-ethical ones.
- It is ethically proper to violate an ethical principle only when it is clearly necessary to advance another true ethical principle, which, according to the decision-maker's conscience, will produce the greatest balance of good in the long run.

**Framework for Understanding Ethical Decision Making**

**![](file:////Users/mivu/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)**

- The framework for ethical decision making does not describe the steps of ethical decisions process.
- It outlines the factors and processes related to ethical decision making.

**Ethical Issue Intensity**
- Ethical issue intensity can be defined as the relevance or importance of an ethical issue in the eyes of the individual, work group, and/or organization.
- Ethical issue intensity reflects the ethical sensitivity of the individual or work group that faces the ethical decision making process.

**Individual Factors**
- Gender―women are generally “more ethical” than men.
- Education or work experience―the more education or work experience that one has, the better he or she is at ethical decision making.
- Nationality―culture appears to be significant in affect of ethical decision making.
- Age―the older you are, the more ethical you are.
- Locus of control― external control vs. Internal control.
	-  external control, see themselves as going with the flow because that’s all they can do.
	- internal control, believe that they control the events in their lives by their own effort and skill

**Organizational Factors**
 - The organization’s values often have greater influence on decisions than a person’s own values.
-  The more ethical employees perceive an organization’s culture to be, the less likely they are to make unethical decisions.

**Opportunity**
- Opportunity describes the conditions in an organization that limit or permit ethical or unethical behavior.
- Opportunity results from conditions that either  provide rewards, whether internal or external, or fail to erect barriers against unethical behavior.

**Things to Ask Yourself**
Before making a difficult decision, consider asking yourself the following questions to see if you are on ethical thin ice.
- Does your decision conflict with any of the core ethical values ( i.e. Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship).
- Think of someone whose moral judgment you respect. What would that person do?
- How will your decision affect others?
- Ask yourself: Are my actions legal?
- Ask yourself: Are my actions legal?
- Are there regulations, rules, or policies that restrict your choices/ actions?
- Would your decision be perceived as unethical?
- How would your decision look if it were reported on the news or in another public forum?
- What would a reasonable person do? How would they perceive your decision?
- Would you be proud of your choice if your child were to find out? Would you want them to make the same choice?
- Could you rationally and honestly defend your decision?
- Will you sleep soundly tonight?

**Ethical Decision-Making Process**

- **STEP1: Identify the Ethical Problem**
	- Don’t jump to solutions without first identifying the ethical issue(s) in the situation.
	- The decision maker must be able to define ethical basis for the issue you want to focus on.
	- There may be multiple ethical issues – focus on one major one at a time.

- **STEP 2: Collect Relevant Information**
	- The decision maker should seek to gather as much information as possible about which rights are being abandoned and to what degree.
	- Questions to ask: Who, what, where, when, how, and why.
	- However, facts may be difficult to find because of the uncertainty often found around ethical issues
	- Assemble as many facts as possible before proceeding
	- Clarify what assumptions you are making!

- **STEP 3: Evaluate the Information**
	- Once the information has been collected, the decision maker must apply some type of standard or assessment criterion to evaluate the situation.
	- The decision maker might use one of the main ethics theories—utilitarianism, rights, or justice.

- **STEP 4: Consider Alternatives**
	- The decision maker needs to generate a set of possible action alternatives.
	- Ask yourself: What could I do in this situation? Think about a variety of options. 

- **STEP 5: Make a Decision**
	- A decision maker selects a course of action that is supported by all the ethics theories or other evaluation criteria used in the decision- making process.

- **STEP 6: Act or Implement**
	- The decision maker, if truly seeking to resolve the problem being considered, must take action.
	- Once the action alternatives have been identified in Step 4 and the optimal response is selected in Step 5, the action is taken in Step 6

- **STEP 7: Review the Action**
	- Once the action has been taken and the results are known, the decision maker should review the consequences of the action.
	-  If the optimal resolution to the problem is not achieved, the decision maker may need to modify the actions being taken or return to the beginning of the decision-making process

**PLUS Ethical Decision-Making Model**
- This model is one of the most used and widely cited ethical models.
- To create a clear and cohesive approach to implementing a solution to an ethical problem; the model is set in a way that it gives the leader “ethical filters” to make decisions.
- The letters in PLUS each stand for a filter that leaders can use for decision-making:
	- P – Policies and Procedures: Is the decision in line with the policies laid out by the company?
	- L – Legal: Will this violate any legal parameters or regulations?
	- U – Universal: How does this relate to the values and principles established for the organisation to operate? Is it in tune with core values and the company culture?
	- S – Self: Does it meet my standards of fairness and justice? This particular lens fits well with the virtue approach that is a part of the five common standards mentioned above.
