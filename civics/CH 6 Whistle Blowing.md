**The Whistle Blowing**
- A disclosure of information in which major unethical action takes place _within an organization, while the employees have obligations to maintain confidentiality.
- Necessarily involves the release of _non-public_ information;
- Information should be evidence of significant misconduct on the part of an organization/members.

**Definition of Whistle-Blower**
- One who reveals wrong-doing within an organization to the public or to those in positions of authority.
- One who discloses information about misconduct in their workplace that they feel violates the law or endangers the welfare of others.
- One who speaks out, typically to expose corruption or dangers to the public or environment

"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." Martin Luther King

**WHAT DOES WHISTLE BLOWING HAVE TO DO WITH ETHICS?**
- Whistle blowing has to do with ethics because:
- It represents a person’s understanding that an action his or her organization is taking is harmful—that it interferes with people’s rights or is unfair or detracts from the common good. 
- Whistle blowing also calls upon the virtues, especially courage, as standing up for principles can be a punishing experience. 

**Purpose of Whistle Blowing**
- To draw attention to unethical, inappropriate or incompetent conduct which has or may have detrimental effects either for the institution or for those affected by its functions.
- It extends to situations where an individual believes that an activity is harmful while others involved are not aware of it or reject the perception that is involved.
- Implies a concern for the protection of ethical values which dominates a concern for self- preservation.

**Types of Whistle-Blowing**
- Internal Whistle-Blowing
   - Internal whistleblowing is the act of reporting wrongdoing to another party within one’s company or organization. 
   - For example, an employee at one branch of a chain of coffee shops who reports wage and hour violations at their store to the company’s corporate headquarters is an internal whistleblower.
- Personal Whistle blowing 
   - It is blowing the whistle on the offender 
   - Here the charge is not against the organization or system but against one individual 
- External Whistle-Blowing
   - An external whistleblower,  is an individual who reports wrongdoing to sources outside his or her company, such as law enforcement or the media.

**Negative Consequences**
- Fire- Employers may fire a whistleblower, or pressure them into quitting.
- Retaliation- Even though the federal government has made protection laws for whistle-blowers, their work place could still be filled with hostility or resentment. Employees may be subject to the cold shoulder or snubbing.
- Challenges in Trust- After an incident like whistle-blowing managers and employees may not trust the person that may have told trade secrets.
- Stress- Most employees stay at their place of employment because it's illegal to fire someone for whistle-blowing. However, the stress of the retaliation can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and headaches. 

**What to think about**
- The “mom” test:
	“I’m going to be in this industry a long time.  Will this damage my reputation with my boss, colleagues, future customers or employers?”
- The personal responsibility test:
	- Weigh personal obligations to family and etc. that can only be met if you have an income.  
	- “Will harm avoided by greater than harm incurred?”
		(The greater harm should be prevented by committing the lesser harm)
	- This principle has two major components: 
	 1. The greater harm should be prevented by committing the lesser harm and 
	 2.  Personal injury should be incurred to prevent general injury.

**How to Blow the Whistle**
- Do it anonymously
	let the evidence speak for itself and protect yourself if possible
 - Do it in a group
	charges have more weight and won’t seem like a personal campaign.
 - Present just the evidence
	leave interpretation of facts to others.
- Work through internal channels
	start with your immediate supervisor or follow the standard reporting procedure
- Work through external channels
	go public (biggest risk)

**Stages of Whistle Blowing** 
- Stage One – Is There a Potential Whistle Blowing Scenario ?
- Stage Two – Seriousness Test
- Stage Three – Reality Check
- Stage Four – Becoming Aware of the Big Picture
- Stage Five – Forcing Management Recognition of the Problem
- Stage Six – Taking the Problem to Upper Management
- Stage Seven – Going Outside the Organization
- Stage Eight – Living with The Results

  

**Stages of Whistle Blowing** 

- Stage One – Is There a Potential Whistle Blowing Scenario ?
	- A potential whistle blowing incident begins with condition : 
		- Action that you believe is ethically wrong.

- Stage Two – Seriousness Test
	- Ask yourself is if the issue is serious enough to merit your concern
	- Most concerns that pass through stage one are likely to fail the seriousness test

- Stage Three – Reality Check
	- Discuss the issue with colleagues or someone whose opinion you trust. 
	- If they have a different view try to understand why.

- Stage Four – Becoming Aware of the Big Picture
	- You need to get beyond your individual prospective and see the problem in a broader setting.
	- You need to acquire more information

- Stage Five – Forcing Management Recognition of the Problem
	- Try and get the problem solved from within organization with as little hard feelings as possible.

- Stage Six – Taking the Problem to Upper Management
	- You select someone who: 
		- Has interest and responsibility in the area. 
		- Is likely to be sympathetic. 
		- Has the influence to get something done.

- Stage Seven – Going Outside the Organization
	- Contrary to popular belief newspapers are not a great place to go
	- Reporters like to sell stories 
	- Regulatory agencies and legal authorities are a better choice

- Stage Eight – Living with The Results
	- A whistle blower essentially never continues a happy career in the same organization.

**When is Whistle-Blowing Ethical?**
CRITERIA FOR JUSTIFIABLE WHISTLEBLOWING:
According to _Richard T De George_ there are three conditions that must hold for whistle-blowing to be morally permissible, and two additional conditions that must hold for it to be morally obligatory. 

**When is Whistle-Blowing Ethical?**
The three conditions that must hold for it to be morally permissible are: 
1. When the company, through a product or decision, will cause considerable harm to the public or break existing laws
2. When the employee identifies a serious threat of harm
3. When the employee’s immediate supervisor does not act, the employee should exhaust the internal procedures and chain of command to the board of directors
The two additional conditions for Whistle blowing to be morally obligatory: 
4. Whistleblower must have accessible documented evidence that would convince a reasonable, impartial observer that one's view of the situation is correct, and that the company's product or practice posses a serious and likely danger to the public or to the user of the product.
5. The employee must have good reason to believe that by going public the necessary changes will be brought about. The chance of being successful must be worth the risk one takes and danger to which one is exposed.

**When is Whistle-Blowing Unethical?**
- Motivation is the opportunity for financial gain or media attention
- Employee is carrying out a campaign against the company
  - **Qui tam lawsuit**: Brought on behalf of the federal government by a whistle-blower under the False Claims Act of 1863

**The Duty to Respond**
Responding to whistle-blowers means addressing their concerns and not firing them

**Addressing the Needs of Whistle-Blowers**
- Well-defined process to document how such complaints are handled
- **Whistle-blower hotline**: Telephone line by which employees can leave messages to alert a company of suspected misconduct without revealing their identity
- Prompt and thorough investigation of all complaints
- Detailed report of all investigations

**Existing Legal Protections**
- **The** **_Civil Service Reform Act of 1978_** prohibits retaliation against federal employees who report waste and corruption in government. The Merit System Protection Board was set up by this act to receive and act on complaints of retaliation. 
- **_The Whistle-Blower Protection Act of 1989_** further strengthened this protection with the creation of the Office of Special Counsel for processing whistle-blower reports. 
- **_Anti-retaliation provisions in various pieces of federal legislation_** protect whistle-blowers in both the private and public sectors, and some statutes even encourage whistle-blowing in fraud cases by awarding a percentage of the funds recovered. 
- **_More than 35 states have laws that protect whistle-blowers_** (although most of these apply only to government employees), and many state courts are limiting the grounds on which employees may be fired. 

**Developing an Effective Whistle-Blowing Policy**

- An effectively communicated statement of responsibility
	- Employees have responsibility to report all concerns about serious unethical or illegal conduct through appropriate internal channel.

- Clearly defined procedure for reporting
	- Employees should be notified a procedure that allows them to report in a confidential manner, and specify the persons to whom reports are to be made, i.e. hotline, anonymous, report to direct supervisor etc. 

- Well-trained personnel to receive and investigate report
	- Skills of personnel are very important, need to maintain confidentiality, and conduct fair and thorough investigation
	- Need to be well-trained and have sufficient authority

- Commitment to take appropriate action
	- Employees must be ensured by both word and deed that suspected wrongdoing will not be ignored and misused.
	- Reporting employees will be informed about the outcome of an investigation and the action taken.

- A guarantee against retaliation
	- Assure that employees will not suffer retaliation for making reports in good faith.
