**Computer and Internet Crime** 
   **_Quote_**: In view of all the deadly computer viruses that have been spreading lately, Weekend Update would like to remind you: when you link up to another computer, you’re linking up to every computer that that computer has ever linked up to. (Dennis Miller, Saturday Night Live)

**Real Case: Sasser Worm**
- Unleashed in April 2004, the Sasser worm hit IT systems around the world hard and fast.

- Didn’t spread through e-mail, but moved undetected across the Internet from computer to computer
- Exploited the weakness in Windows XP and 2000 
- By the first week of May, American Express, the Associated Press, the British Coast Guard, universities and hospitals reported that Sasser worm has swamped their systems
- Delta Airlines cancelled around 40 flights and delayed many others
- Microsoft posted a $250,000 reward
- By mid-May, authorities apprehended Sven Jaschan, a German teenager.
- Jaschan confessed and was convicted after a three-day trial:

**Introduction to Ethics**  
Quote from Aristotle:
	“Man, when perfected, is the best of the animals, but when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all”

**What is Ethics?**
- Each society forms a **set of rules** that establishes the boundaries of generally accepted behavior.
- These rules are often expressed in statements about how people should behave, and they fit together to form the **moral code** by which a society lives.
- **Ethics** is the set of beliefs about right and wrong behavior.
- Ethical behavior conforms to generally accepted social norms, many of which are almost universal.
- **Virtues** are habits that incline people to do what is acceptable, and **vices** are habits of unacceptable behavior
- People’s virtues and vices help define their **value system** – the complex scheme of moral values by which they live

**Professional Codes of Ethics**
- A professional code of ethics states the principles and core values that are essential to the work of a particular occupational group.
- Association of Computing Machinery ACM (founded 1947) has a code of ethics and professional conduct. See: 
  http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html
- Association of Information Technology Professionals AITP (founded 1996) – provides quality IT-related education, information on relevant IT issues, and forums for networking with experienced peers and other IT professionals. The AITP also has a code of ethics, see:
    http://www.aitp.org/join/SCOH17CodeEthicsStdsCdt.pdf
- Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE – CS) (founded in 1946). The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice:

**Common Ethical Issues for IT Users**
- **Software Piracy**: a common violation occurs when employees copy software from their work computers for use at home
- **Inappropriate Use of Computing Resources**: some employees use their work computers to surf popular Web sites that have nothing to do with their jobs. 
	    “Half of Fortune 500 companies have dealt with at least one incident related to computer porn in the workplace over the past 12 months, according to a survey released today. Corporations are taking the problem seriously, and fired the offenders in 44% of the cases    and disciplined those responsible in 41% of the instances”.  

- **Inappropriate Sharing of Information:** 
	- Organizations stored vast amount of information that can be classified as private or confidential. 
	- Private data describes individual employees – for example, salary, attendance, performance rating, health record. 
	- Confidential information describes a company and its operations: sales, promotion plans, research and development. 
	- Sharing this information with unauthorized party, even inadvertently, has violated someone’s privacy or created the potential that company information could fall into the hands of competitors. 

**Supporting The Ethical Practices of IT Users**
- **Defining and Limiting the Appropriate Use of IT Resources**
	- Companies must develop, communicate and enforce written guidelines that encourage employees to respect corporate IT resources and use them to enhance their job performance.
	- Effective guidelines allow some level of personal use while prohibiting employees from visiting objectionable Web sites or using company e-mail to send offensive or harassing messages.

- **Establishing Guidelines for Use of Company Software**
	- Company IT managers must provide clear rules that govern the use of home computers and associated software.
	- The goal should be to ensure that employees have legal copies of all software

- **Structuring Information Systems to Protect Data and Information**
	- Implement system and procedures that limit data access to employees who need it.
	- Employees should be prohibited from accessing the data about research and development results, product formulae, and staffing projections if they don’t need it to do their job 

- **Installing and Maintaining a Corporate Firewall**
	- Firewall is a software or hardware device that serves as a barrier between a company and the outside world and limits access to the company’s network based on the Internet usage policy.
	- Firewall can be configured to serve as an effective detergent unauthorized Web surfing by blocking access to specific, objectionable Web sites.
	 - Firewall can serve as an effective barrier to incoming e-mail from certain Web sites, companies or users
	- Can be programmed to block e-mail with certain kinds of attachments, which reduces the risk of harmful computer viruses

**Computer and Internet Crime  IT Security Incidents**
- The security of IT used in business is very important
- Although, the necessity of security is obvious, it often must be balanced against other business needs and issues
- IT professionals and IT users all face a number of ethical decisions regarding IT security:

**Ethical Decisions Regarding IT Security**
- Business managers, IP professionals, and IT users all face a number of ethical decisions regarding IT security:
	- If their firm is a victim of a computer crime, should they pursue prosecution of the criminals at all costs, should they maintain a low profile to avoid the negative publicity, must they inform their affected customers, or should they take some other actions?
	- How much effort and money should be spent to safeguard against computer crime (how safe is safe enough?)
	- If their firm produces software with defects that allow hackers to attack customer data and computers, what actions should they take?
	- What tactics should management ask employees to use to gather competitive intelligence without doing anything illegal?
	- What should be done if recommended computer security safeguards make life more difficult for customers and employees, resulting in lost sales and increasing costs?

**What could be done to deal with the increasing number of IT-related security incidents, not only in USA but around the world?**
To deal with the incidents, the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) was established in 1988 at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) – federally funded research and development center at Carnegie Mellon: 
- Study Internet Security vulnerabilities
- Handle Computer Security Incidents
- Publish Security Alerts
- Research long-term changes in networked systems
- Develop information and training
- Conduct ongoing public awareness campaign

**Some Statistics**
- The number of security problems reported to CERT/CC grew between 1997 and 2003 from 2134 to 137,529
- From 2004 the CERT/CC no longer publishes the number of incidents reported

**Challenges**
- Increasing complexity increases vulnerability:
	- The computing environment has become very complex
	- Networks, computers, OS, applications, Web sites, switches, routers and gateways are interconnected and driven by hundreds of millions of lines of code
	- The number of possible entry points to a network expands continually as more devices are added, increasing the possibility of security breaches  

- Higher computer user expectations:
	- Time means money
	- Help desks are under intense pressure to provide fast responses to user’s questions. 
	- Sometimes forgets to verify user’s identities, or to check authorization to perform a requested action 

- Expanding and changing systems introduce new risks:
	- Businesses had moved from an era of stand-alone computers to a network era – personal computers connect to networks with millions of other computers all capable of sharing information. 
	- E-commerce, mobile computing, collaborative work groups, global business
	- It is increasingly difficult to keep up with the pace of technological change, successfully perform an ongoing assessment of new security risks, and implement approaches for dealing with them

- Increases reliance on commercial software with known vulnerabilities:
	- **Exploit** is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability. Often, this attack is due to poor system design or implementation.
	- Once a vulnerability is discovered, software developers create and issue a “fix” or **patch** to eliminate the problem. Users are responsible for obtaining and installing the patch. Any delay in installing a patch exposes the user to a security breach.  
	- A rate of discovering software vulnerabilities exceeds 10 per day, creating a serious work overload for developers who are responsible for security fixes. 

**Challenges: Increases reliance on commercial software with known vulnerabilities:**

- **A zero-day** attack take place BEFORE the security community, or a software developer knows about a vulnerability or has been able to repair it.
- Malicious hackers are getting better and faster at exploiting flaws. 
- In August 2005, the ZOTOB computer worm began targeting corporate networks that run Windows 2000, less than a week after Microsoft released a critical patch addressing the vulnerability 
  http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/internet/08/16/computer.worm/index.html
- In an attempt to avoid further attacks and the ultimate zero-day attack, computer security firms and software manufactures are paying hackers to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**Types of Attacks**
- Security incidents can take many forms, but one of the most frequent is an attack on a networked computer from outside source. 
- Most attacks involve:
	- Viruses
	- Worms
	- Trojan Horses
	- Denial – of – Service (DoS)
