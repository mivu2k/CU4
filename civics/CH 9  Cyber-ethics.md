**Hacktivism**
- **Hacktivism** is a form of activism or political protest that utilizes hacking techniques to raise awareness, disrupt systems, or advance a specific cause.

- Hacktivists are driven by a desire to effect change on a political or social level, not by financial gain. 

**Computer ethics**

- Postwar period:  
	- the rise of ‘artificial intelligence’ and fears of social domination by computers 
	- large-scale computation enabling greater lethality of  military weaponry

- Microcomputers, networking and personal computers
	- software and IPRs
	- hacking

- Internet and bandwidth
	- privacy and protection from malicious individuals
	- dependency in the age of informational capitalism

- Cloud computing

**Conceptualising computers and ethics**
“Computer and information technology creates  new possibilities; it instruments human action in new ways.  The ethical issues that are thereby created are not out of the realm of human under-standing, but they have unique features with which we must come to grips.” (Johnson)

**Computers and society:  the case of  software**
- Software (Johnson)
	- A series of mental processes that cannot be owned, an internal structuring of a computer that forms a part of the machine, or a standalone product with commercial value?
	- Traditionalist view: adapt existing tools such as patents  and copyright?  But can this approach capture the novel features and their (sometimes unintended) applications?
- Social context:  moral, cultural, political ideas
   “the study of computer ethics turns out [to] be the study of human beings and society -- our goals and values, our norms of behavior, the way we organize ourselves and assign rights and responsibilities”

**Are computer ethical issues unique?**
- New entities: programmes, software, microchips, Websites, video games (MMORPGs), the Cloud
- Scale of organised activity:  data collection, calculation, statistical analysis
- Scale of calculations:  new types of knowledge in fields such as meteorology, economics, military technology
- Inherent unreliability of computer systems:  new ways  of thinking about risk, accountability and liability
- Power and pervasiveness:  dependency on computers  for all aspects of modern living, sometimes life itself

	_–_ or deception?
	‘On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog’

**Promoting an ethical approach and the problem of moral philosophy**
- Internet ethics is derived from Western moral philosophy, thus based on Judeao-Christian and European cultural heritage
- The foundations of different ethical frameworks cannot be fully rationalised – and therefore, conceptualisations of ethical standards and approaches to governance (e.g. deontology, utilitarianism, notions of human rights etc.) don’t lend themselves to multicultural rationalisation

**Universal ethics** 
- Values? (worth, esteem, etc.)
	- Is privacy an intrinsic social value or is it instrumental ?
- Truly _universal_ ethics are based on _virtues_:
	- Honesty and trustworthiness
	- Benevolence and generosity
	- Excellence
	- Courage
	- Honour and respect
	- Justice

**Psychology of moral autonomy  (Lawrence Kohlberg)**
- Pre-conventional level: self-benefit and the avoidance of punishment
- Conventional level: family, group or social norms uncritically accepted as standards of morality
- Post conventional level: individual recognition that right and wrong is not reducible to self-interest or social convention
	- autonomous individuals who think for themselves and do not assume that customs are always right
	- seek to live by general, universal principles such as moral integrity, respect, and the “Golden Rule”

**Moral Heuristics**
- Is it honourable?  Is there anyone from whom we would like    to hide the action?
- Is it honest?  Does it violate any agreement, actual or implied, or otherwise betray a trust?
- Does it avoid the possibility of conflict of interest?  Are there other considerations that might bias your judgement?
- Is it within your area of competence?  Is it possible that your best effort will not be adequate?
- Is it fair?  Is it detrimental to the legitimate interests of others?
- Is it considerate?  Will it violate confidentiality or privacy,         or otherwise harm anyone or anything?
- Is it conservative?  Does it unnecessarily squander time            or otherwise valuable resources?
