### 1. Loop Control in Assembly Language

In Assembly, loops are typically implemented using conditional jump instructions and a counter.

#### Example: Summing Array Elements

Consider a C++ loop to sum array elements:


```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    short num1[10]={1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2};
    short *bx = num1;
    short counter = 10;
    short ax=0;
    for(counter=10; counter>0; --counter)
    {
        ax = ax + *bx;
        bx = bx + 1;
    }
    bx = num1;
    bx = bx + 10;
    cout<<"Sum of arrary elements: "<<ax<<endl;
    *bx = ax;
    return 0;
}
```

The equivalent Assembly code would look like this:

Code snippet

```rust
[org 0x100]

mov bx, num1  ; point bx to first number (address of num1)
mov cx, 10    ; load numbers count into CX register

l1:           ; This is a label for the start of the loop
    add ax, [bx]  ; add number pointed by bx to ax (dereference bx)

    add bx, 2     ; Increment BX by 2 bytes because 'num1' elements are words (2 bytes each).
                  ; This moves the pointer to the next word in the array.
    sub cx, 1     ; Decrement the loop counter (CX)
    jnz l1        ; Jump to label 'l1' if the Zero Flag (ZF) is not set (i.e., CX is not zero)

mov [num1+20], ax ; write back result. 'num1+20' points to the memory location
                  ; immediately after the array, where the sum will be stored (10 words * 2 bytes/word = 20 bytes offset).

num1: dw 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ; Declaration of the array 'num1' with 10 words (dw).

mov ax, 0x4c00
int 0x21
```

#### Explanation of Assembly Code Logic:

- **`mov bx, num1`**: This instruction moves the _address_ (offset) of the `num1` array into the `BX` register. It's crucial to understand that `num1` without brackets refers to the address, while `[num1]` would refer to the _content_ at that address.
    
- **`mov cx, 10`**: The `CX` register is commonly used as a loop counter. Here, it's initialized to `10` because there are 10 elements in the array.
    
- **`l1:`** : This defines a label, serving as the target for the `jnz` instruction.
    
- **`add ax, [bx]`**: This instruction adds the _content_ of the memory location pointed to by `BX` (the current array element) to the `AX` register (which acts as the accumulator for the sum, initialized to 0 implicitly or explicitly before the loop).
    
- **`add bx, 2`**: Since `num1` is an array of `DW` (Define Word) which means each element is 2 bytes, `BX` must be incremented by 2 to point to the next word in the array.
    
- **`sub cx, 1`**: This decrements the loop counter `CX` by 1.
    
- **`jnz l1`**: This is a conditional jump instruction. `JNZ` stands for "Jump if Not Zero". It checks the Zero Flag (ZF) in the Flag Register. If `ZF` is 0 (meaning the result of `sub cx, 1` was not zero, i.e., `CX` is not yet 0), the program jumps back to the `l1` label, continuing the loop. When `CX` becomes 0, `ZF` will be set to 1, and the `jnz` instruction will not jump, causing the loop to terminate.
    
- **`mov [num1+20], ax`**: After the loop finishes, the final sum in `AX` is stored at a memory location 20 bytes (10 words * 2 bytes/word) beyond the start of `num1`. This effectively places the sum immediately after the array itself.
    

#### Key Takeaways for Loop Control:

- Labels are used to define jump targets for loop iteration.
    
- A counter register (typically `CX`) controls the number of iterations.
    
- Conditional jump instructions (`jnz`, `loop`, etc.) are used to continue or terminate the loop based on the counter's value or other conditions.
    
- Pointer registers (`BX`, `SI`, `DI`) are used to traverse data structures like arrays. The increment value for these pointers depends on the size of the data elements.
