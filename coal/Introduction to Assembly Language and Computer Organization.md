### 1. Basic Computer Architecture

- **Microprocessor-based systems** are electrical systems comprising microprocessors, memories, I/O units, and other peripherals. Microprocessors act as the "brains" of these systems, accessing memories and other units via buses. Their operations are controlled by instructions stored in memory.
    
- A **microprocessor** is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) fabricated on a single integrated circuit. Not all integrated circuits are microprocessors, but microprocessors are integrated circuits that form the core of computing capability in circuits.
    
- The 
    
    **Memory Address Register (MAR)** is a component within a simple microprocessor architecture.
    
- **Evolution of Computers**:
    
    - **First Generation (1939-1954):** Vacuum tube
        
    - **Second Generation (1954-1959):** Transistor
        
    - **Third Generation (1959-1971):** IC (Integrated Circuit)
        
    - **Fourth Generation (1971-present):** Microprocessor
        

### 2. Levels of Programming Languages

- **Machine Language:** Consists of individual instructions executed directly by the CPU.
    
- **Assembly Language (Low-Level Language):** Designed for specific processor families. It comprises symbolic instructions that directly correspond to machine language instructions on a one-to-one basis and are assembled into machine language.
    
- **High-Level Languages (e.g., C, C++):** Designed to abstract away the technicalities of a particular computer. Statements in high-level languages typically compile into many low-level instructions.
    

### 3. Advantages and Reasons for Using Assembly Language

- **Advantages:**
    
    - Shows how programs interface with the processor, operating system, and BIOS.
        
    - Clarifies how data is represented and stored in memory and external devices.
        
    - Explains how the processor accesses and executes instructions, and how instructions process data.
        
    - Clarifies how a program accesses external devices.
        
- **Reasons for Use:**
    
    - Requires considerably less memory and execution time compared to high-level languages.
        
    - Enables programmers to perform highly technical tasks that would be difficult or impossible in high-level languages.
        
    - Commonly used to recode time-critical sections of code for optimization, even when the main application is developed in a high-level language.
        
    - Resident programs and interrupt service routines are almost always developed in Assembly Language.
        
    - Provides direct access to computer hardware.
        
- **Real-world Applications**:
    
    - **Operating Systems:** Used for low-level hardware access and critical operations.
        
    - **Device Drivers:** Developed using assembly language to allow computers to interact with specific hardware devices.
        
    - **Embedded Systems:** Widely used in microcontrollers and specialized devices with limited processing power and memory.
        
    - **Reverse Engineering:** Provides a detailed understanding of machine code for analyzing malware, debugging software, and studying internal workings of operating systems.
        

### 4. Memory Addressing and Word Representation

- **Memory Dimensions:** Horizontal dimensions refer to the width of a memory cell, while vertical dimensions refer to the size of memory.
    
- Intel PCs address memory by bytes, with each byte having a unique address starting from 0.
    
- The CPU can access one or more bytes at a time, depending on the model.
    
- **Reverse Byte Sequence (Little Endian):** The processor stores data in memory with the low-order byte at the low memory address and the high-order byte at the high memory address. When the processor retrieves the data, it reverses the bytes to their actual order.
    
- **Word Representation:** For numbers 16 bits or greater, the byte order in memory must be decided. Intel uses little endian notation, meaning the lesser significant byte is at the lesser address.
    

### 5. Registers

Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU.

#### 5.1. 

General Purpose Registers (iAPX 88, 16-bit):

- **AX (Accumulator Register):** Used for mathematical, arithmetic, and logical operations. Can also store addresses of other memory locations.
    
    - **AH (High 8-bit)** and **AL (Low 8-bit)** are parts of AX.
        
- **BX (Base Register):** Used to store the starting (base) address of any data structure, like an array.
    
    - **BH (High 8-bit)** and **BL (Low 8-bit)** are parts of BX.
        
- **CX (Counter Register):** Stores the value of a loop counter variable. Compares with the register and increments on each iteration.
    
- **DX (Destination Register):** Primarily used for destinations, storing the final output of operations. For example, if a multiplication result is 32 bits, and AX is 16 bits, DX would hold the higher 16 bits.
    

#### 5.2. 

Pointer / Index / Base Registers (iAPX 88, 16-bit):

- **SI (Source Index):**
    
- **DI (Destination Index):**
    
- **IP (Instruction Pointer):** Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed.
    
- **SP (Stack Pointer):**
    
- **BP (Base Pointer):**
    

#### 5.3. Flag Register

- In 8086 architecture, the flag register is 16 bits, with 9 active bits and empty spaces reserved for future bits.
    
- It represents the overall state of the microprocessor, with each bit having a specific meaning and a value of either 0 or 1.
    
- **Key Flags**:
    
    - **CF (Carry Flag):** Set to 1 if there's a carry in the last bit of an addition operation; otherwise, 0.
        
    - **PF (Parity Flag):** Used for error detection and correction. Can be set for even or odd parity.
        
    - **AF (Auxiliary Flag):** Set to 1 if there's a carry after the 3rd bit (within a nibble).
        
    - **ZF (Zero Flag):** Set to 1 if the result of an operation is 0.
        
    - **SF (Sign Flag):** Set to 0 for a positive result, and 1 for a negative result.
        
    - **TF (Trap Flag):** Facilitates debuggers. When set to 1, the debugger enters single-step execution mode.
        
    - **IF (Interrupt Flag):** Handles signals from hardware or software to the CPU.
        
    - **DF (Direction Flag):** Determines the processing direction of a string (left-to-right or right-to-left).
        
    - **OF (Overflow Flag):**
        

### 6. Instruction Groups

Assembly language instructions are categorized into groups:

- **Data Movement Instructions:** Used to move data between registers or between registers and memory (e.g., `mov ax,bx`, `lda 89`).
    
- **Arithmetic / Logic Instructions:** Perform arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., `add bx,0534`, `and ax,1234`).
    
    - **Division (`DIV`):**
        
        - 8086 microprocessor supports division. The implied parameter for the dividend is 
            
            `AX` for 16-bit numbers, or `DX:AX` for 32-bit numbers (higher 16 bits in `DX`, lower 16 bits in `AX`).
            
        - If the divider is 8-bit (e.g., `Div Bl`), the dividend is 16-bit in `AX`. If the divider is 16-bit (e.g., 
            
            `Div Bx`), the dividend is 32-bit in `DX:AX`.
            
        - The result (quotient and remainder) is stored in 
            
            `AX` (quotient) and `DX` (remainder) if the dividend is 32 bits.
            
        - **Divide Overflow Error:** Occurs if the division result exceeds the capacity of the `AX` register (e.g., more than 16 bits for a 16-bit divider and 32-bit dividend, or more than 8 bits for an 8-bit divider and 16-bit dividend).
            
    - **Compare (`CMP`) vs. Subtract (`SUB`)**:
        
        - `CMP Operand1, Operand2`: Compares two operands and sets flags (e.g., `ZF=1` if equal), but does not store the result.
            
        - `SUB Operand1, Operand2`: Subtracts `Operand2` from `Operand1` and stores the result in `Operand1`.
            
- **Program Control Group Instructions:** Control the execution flow of a program.
    
- **Special Group Instructions:** Change CPU behavior.
    
    - `cli`: Clears the Interrupt Flag (sets it to 0).
        
    - `sti`: Sets the Interrupt Flag (sets it to 1).
        
    - `CLD`: Clears the Direction Flag (data goes forwards).
        
    - `STD`: Sets the Direction Flag (data goes backwards).
        
    - `PUSHF`: Pushes flags onto the stack.
        
    - `POPF`: Restores the Flag Register from the stack.
        

### 7. Program Tools

- **Assembler (NASM - The Netwide Assembler):** Translates assembly code into machine code.
    
    - Command: 
        
        `nasm first.asm –o fir.com`.
        
- **Linker (ALINK):** Links object files to create an executable program.
    
- **Debugger (AFD - Advanced Full Screen Debugger):** Used to observe the values of registers and execute program instructions step-by-step (using F1 and F2 keys).
    
    - Command: 
        
        `afd fir.com`.
        
- **Commands to Execute Code:**
    
    - `cls`: Clears the DOSBox screen.
        
    - `mount m: path_to_directory`: Mounts a directory as a drive.
        
    - `dir`: Displays files in the current directory.
        
    - `fir.com`: Executes the assembled program.
        
- **Listing File:**
    
    - Create: 
        
        `nasm first.asm –l firstlist.lst`.
        
    - View: 
        
        `type firstlist.lst`.
        

### 8. Segmented Memory Model

- The segmented memory model was introduced for 
    
    **compatibility** (running old processor programs on new ones) and to **increase memory** beyond the 16-bit processing limit.
    
- Memory is divided into segments. At any given time, 256KB of memory can be accessed (64KB x 4 segments).
    

#### 8.1. 

Segment Registers: Store starting addresses of segments.

- **CSR (Code Segment Register):** Stores the starting address of the code segment. It is fixedly associated with the Instruction Pointer (IP).
    
- **DSR (Data Segment Register):** Stores the starting address of the data segment.
    
- **SSR (Stack Segment Register):** Stores the starting address of the stack segment. It is fixedly associated with the Stack Pointer (SP).
    
- **ESR (Extra Segment Register):** Stores the starting address of an extra segment. It is used to access two distant memory areas simultaneously and plays a special role in string instructions. It can only be an extra data segment.
    

#### 8.2. 

Offset Registers: Store the distance from the start of a segment.

- **IP (Instruction Pointer):** Offset register for the Code Segment. It is tied to 
    
    `CS` and cannot access memory in other segments.
    
- **BP (Base Pointer):** Offset register for the Stack Segment. It is attached to 
    
    `SS` by default.
    
- **SP (Stack Pointer):** Offset register for the Stack Segment. It is tied to 
    
    `SS`.
    
- Other offset registers like `SI`, `DI`, or `BX` have `DS` as their default segment for register indirect memory access, but this can be overridden. If 
    
    `BP` is used, the default segment is `SS`.
    
- The associations of 
    
    `IP` with `CS` and `SP` with `SS` are fixed, while other associations can be changed.
    

### 9. Logical to Physical Address Calculation

- **Physical Address:** The 20-bit actual address of a program in memory, not directly visible to the programmer.
    
- **Logical Address:** The address used by the CPU to access the physical address of memory, divided into a 16-bit segment address and a 4-bit offset address. This is visible to the programmer.
    
- **Address Translation:** The processor uses 16-bit segment registers and 16-bit offset registers to accommodate 20-bit memory addresses. A 20-bit physical address is calculated by combining the 16-bit segment address (shifted left by 4 bits, or multiplied by 16) and the 16-bit offset address.
    
    - Physical Address = (Segment Register Value * 16) + Offset Register Value.
        
- **Paragraph Boundaries:** The Memory Address Space (MAS) is divided into 65,536 paragraphs, with each paragraph being 16 consecutive bytes and starting at a physical address whose rightmost hexadecimal digit is zero.
    
- Segments can overlap and start at different paragraph boundaries.
